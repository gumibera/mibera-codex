## Wartime

**Name:** Wartime

**Image Files:**

![Wartime](../images/face%20accessories__z60/SS4_milady_wartime.webp)

**Brief Visual Description:** Blood splattered upwards.

**Dominant Colors:** Blood red

**Reasoning for Inclusion within Mibera:** Cultural reference within Milady around 2022, called

the ‘wartime’ where a lot of Miladys put blood splatter on top of their Milady PFP.

What I can conclude from different sources of information:

- There was an ongoing “movement” around 2023 involving Milady community and

Charlotte Fang - provoking a “wartime pfp” movement in which some of the community

members put blood splatters on their Milady PFP.

- Vitalik posted a few tweets showing support to Milady as well as changing his PFP to

Milady Maker, provoking a bigger noise surrounding the collection.

- Charlotte Fang got tangled in multiple controversies; two that are heavily related to this

theme (in my opinion) is where he was doxxed to be behind “Miya”, a highly

controversial ‘female’ online persona who faked over-the-counter sales of human blood

for "rituals" as part of internet trolling, as well as an asset of a shirt bearing the word

"Treblinka"—a reference to a Nazi concentration camp from World War II with ‘SS’ rank.

## Dots

**Name:** Dots

**Image Files:**

![Dots](../images/face%20accessories__z60/SS3_milady_Dots.webp)

**Brief Visual Description:** Three small black dots under each eye.

**Dominant Colors:** Black

**Reasoning for Inclusion within Mibera:** Based on an existing Milady Maker trait. The Milady

trait features both a crescent moon on the forehead and four dots on the cheeks.

**General Real World Trait History:**

**Team Anecdotes:** The decision to include the dots as they are was to differentiate it some from

Milady and allow for the crescent to be on its own. The artist felt that the face accessory would

appear to be a bit cleaner, and more visually flexible that way.

**Research Summary:**

Individual

Mike Tyson, born June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, is a former professional boxer known

for his ferocious style and troubled persona. As a person, Tyson had a turbulent life marked by a

tough upbringing in a crime-ridden neighborhood, leading to juvenile delinquency and jail time

before age 13. He transformed through boxing, mentored by Cus D’Amato, but struggled with

anger, legal issues, and personal loss, including his 2009 divorce and the 2009 death of his

daughter Exodus. He’s since embraced sobriety, philanthropy, and a softer public image, often

showing humor and vulnerability.

Drug-Addiction

Mike Tyson, a former heavyweight boxing champion, has openly discussed his struggles with

drug addiction, particularly cocaine and marijuana, which impacted his career and personal life.

He admitted to using drugs during major fights in the 2000s, including bouts against Lou

Savarese and Danny Williams, and employed methods like a "whizzer" (fake penis with clean

urine) to pass drug tests. Tyson’s drug use began early, with his first cocaine experience at age

11, and escalated after retiring in 2005, leading to arrests and legal issues, including a 2007

guilty plea for cocaine possession and DUI. He has since embraced sobriety, crediting cannabis

for his transformation, and founded Tyson 2.0, a cannabis brand. While not directly linked to

rave culture, his psychedelic use, including mushrooms, aligns with experimental drug trends,

which he claims aided his mental health and fight preparation.

**the original had eight colors:** hot pink (sex), red (life), orange (healing), yellow (sunlight), green

(nature), turquoise (magic/art), indigo (serenity), and violet (spirit). Due to fabric shortages, it

was simplified to six colors by 1979, dropping hot pink and turquoise. Adopted globally, it

evolved with variants like the 2018 Philadelphia flag (adding black and brown for people of

color) and the 2021 Progress flag (including light blue, pink, and white for trans and nonbinary

inclusion).

societies, recognized for gender diversity. Modern activism began in the 20th century, with

pioneers like Magnus Hirschfeld in Germany (1890s) advocating for gender variance. Key

awareness, and the 1966 Compton’s Cafeteria riot in San Francisco, an early transgender

uprising. The Stonewall Riots (1969) boosted the movement, led by trans figures like Marsha P.

**Research Summary:**

The teardrop tattoo originated in prison culture, likely in the mid-20th century, with early

references in the 1970s among Latino gang members in the U.S.

It’s typically inked near the eye and carries varied meanings: a filled teardrop can signify a

murder committed, an outline may indicate attempted murder or a friend’s death, or it can mark

time served or humiliation, like being "owned" by another inmate.

Meanings differ by region, gang, and era, evolving from a criminal badge to a broader symbol of

loss or resilience.
