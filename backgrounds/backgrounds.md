**General Real World Trait History:** Ophiuchus, sometimes called the 13th zodiac sign

(November 29 - December 17), is not officially recognized in traditional Western astrology.

Represented by a serpent-bearer, it’s linked to the constellation of the same name and

associated with healing, wisdom, and transformation, inspired by the mythological figure

Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. Those born under Ophiuchus are said to be intuitive,

curious, and seekers of knowledge, though its inclusion in astrology remains debated and

uncommon.
