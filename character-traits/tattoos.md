**Summary:** Tōshūsai Sharaku was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist active in 1794–1795, known for his vivid kabuki actor portraits. His bold, expressive style, with exaggerated features and dynamic poses, captured the essence of performers. Despite producing around 140 prints in a short period, his identity and life remain mysterious, with theories suggesting he was a Noh actor, samurai, or artist under a pseudonym. His work, initially underappreciated, later gained recognition for its psychological depth and artistic innovation. He vanished from the art scene as abruptly as he appeared, leaving a lasting legacy in ukiyo-e.

**Summary:** The Pythia was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi in ancient Greece, serving as a priestess who delivered prophecies. Seated on a tripod in the temple, she entered a trance-like state, possibly induced by vapors or chewing laurel leaves, to channel divine messages. Her cryptic responses influenced major decisions in Greek society, from politics to warfare. The role was held by women, often chosen for their purity, and the oracle’s prominence lasted from the 8th century BCE until the decline of pagan practices in the 4th century CE.

**Summary:** Caria’s Tyche was associated with symbols such as the mural crown (representing city walls), cornucopia (abundance), and rudder (guiding fate). Her worship in Caria reflected the Hellenistic period’s emphasis on chance and fortune, especially after Alexander the Great’s conquests, when socio-political instability amplified her significance. In Caria, Tyche’s cult was part of a broader trend where cities personified their fortune through her, often depicting her on coins and in statues to invoke prosperity and protection.

**Summary:** UwU Baphomet, is in short a cute version of the figure Baphomet, combining Satanism and Kawaii internet culture. UwU is an emoticon and internet slang used to express cuteness, affection, or happiness, often in anime, gaming, and kawaii culture. It mimics a face with closed, happy eyes (U shapes) and a small, puckered mouth (w), resembling a shy or adorable expression. Popularized online, especially in furry and otaku communities, it’s used in text, memes, and roleplay to convey **playful or wholesome vibes. Example:** “I wuv you >w<” or “so cute UwU.” As for Baphomet, it is a symbolic figure often depicted as a goat-headed, winged, androgynous being with occult and esoteric associations. Originating in the 14th century during the trials of the Knights Templar, where it was falsely linked to their alleged idolatry, the name likely derives from a corruption of "Muhammad." Popularized in the 19th century by occultist Eliphas Levi, who illustrated it as a representation of balance (male/female, good/evil), Baphomet is now tied to modern occultism, Satanism, and mysticism, symbolizing duality and hidden knowledge.

**Summary:** The meaning of the Inverted Pentagram varies according to the traditions and intentions in which it is used. In most interpretations, it symbolizes an inversion of spiritual values, a state where the Spirit is dominated by material or emotional forces. **It can be seen as a reflection of:** - an inner imbalance, - a loss of spiritual bearings, - or submission to primal instincts and drives. In this sense, it acts as a mirror of the state of the human being when he turns away from his higher nature. It symbolizes the human being who, instead of elevating himself, locks himself into the density of matter, in fear, ego or the will to power.

- https://www.kerrang.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-straight-edge-in-2019

**Summary:** The article explores the evolution of the straight edge subculture, a hardcore punk movement originating in the early 1980s, centered on abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs. It highlights how the movement, named after Minor Threat’s 1981 song, has shifted from its militant roots to a more flexible identity in 2020. Core values—avoiding drugs, alcohol, and **smoking—remain, but attitudes vary:** some, like Nathan, treat it as a daily choice, while others, like Trevor of Eighteen Visions, view it as a lifelong commitment, expressing disappointment in those who “break edge.” The article notes a decline in the subculture’s early rigidity, with individuals like Jeremy (age 36) seeing it as second nature, open to possibly drinking later in life. Bands like Martha are still labeled straight edge despite some members no longer adhering, reflecting a less judgmental community. The piece underscores straight edge’s enduring relevance, balancing personal empowerment with evolving social acceptance.

**Summary:** Sufi whirling, also known as "whirling dervishes," is a meditative dance practiced by Sufi Dervishes, primarily within the Mevlevi Order, founded in the 13th century by followers of the mystic poet Rumi in Konya, Turkey. Performers spin in circles to achieve spiritual ecstasy and connect with the divine, symbolizing the soul’s journey toward God and the cosmic order of planets orbiting the sun. Dancers wear traditional white robes with wide skirts (representing the ego’s shroud) and a black cloak (symbolizing the ego’s grave), which is shed during the dance. Accompanied by music like the ney (flute), the ritual involves specific movements, with the right hand raised to receive divine energy and the left lowered to transmit it to earth. Practiced mainly in Turkey and parts of the Middle East, it remains a profound expression of Sufi mysticism, emphasizing unity, love, and transcendence.

**Summary:** Sugar Skull is generally an iconic symbol of Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), a Mexican holiday celebrated on November 1-2 to honor deceased loved ones. Originating from ancient Meso-American traditions, sugar skulls (calaveras) were crafted from abundant sugar as a substitute for real skulls, a practice banned by Spanish colonizers who imposed Catholic rituals. Today, these colorful, decorated skulls symbolize the celebration of life and death, connecting modern Meso-Americans to their ancestors. In contemporary culture, sugar skulls are popular in tattoos, art, and decor, embraced globally for their vibrant, intricate designs.

Primary crops included wheat and barley, grown using rabi cultivation (sown in November, harvested before April floods). Oxen were key for plowing and carts, while cows provided milk and meat. Other domesticated animals like asses, Bactrian camels, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and pigs aided farming and food supply, reflecting a diverse agricultural economy.

**Summary:** The Pythia was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi in ancient Greece, serving as a priestess who delivered prophecies. Seated on a tripod in the temple, she entered a trance-like state, possibly induced by vapors or chewing laurel leaves, to channel divine messages. Her cryptic responses influenced major decisions in Greek society, from politics to warfare. The role was held by women, often chosen for their purity, and the oracle’s prominence lasted from the 8th century BCE until the decline of pagan practices in the 4th century CE.

Despite Nokomis' warnings, Wenonah is seduced by the West Wind (Mudjekeewis), leading to the birth of Hiawatha. Wenonah dies in childbirth, and Nokomis raises Hiawatha, nurturing him with wisdom and care by the shores of Gitche Gumee (Lake Superior). The story highlights themes of ancestry, nature, and matriarchal influence.
