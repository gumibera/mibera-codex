**Summary:** This 2017 Rolling Stone article marks the 20th anniversary of the Heaven's Gate cult's 1997 mass suicide, where 39 members died believing a UFO trailing the Hale-Bopp comet would take their souls to a higher level. **It highlights 10 lesser-known facts:** 1. Borrowed sci-fi imagery from Star Trek, Star Wars, and Close Encounters. 2. First gained attention with a 1975 UFO lecture in Oregon. 3. Members endured the Master Cleanse diet for extended periods. 4. Initially taught ascension to heaven without needing to die. 5. The suicides happened in staged waves over three days. 6. Strict uniformity rules applied to everything, including identical meals. 7. Believed the "Next Level" was genderless; several men (including leader) voluntarily castrated. 8. Final meal was a group dinner at Marie Callender’s restaurant. 9. Surviving ex-members still maintain the cult's original website. 10. Identical Nike Decade sneakers worn by victims were discontinued and became rare collectibles.

In Chicago, Kraftwerk’s albums like Trans-Europe Express (1977) and Computer World (1981) were staples in the DJ sets of early house music innovators like Frankie Knuckles at the Warehouse. In Detroit, Kraftwerk’s impact was even more direct, shaping the “Detroit techno” sound pioneered by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (the Belleville Three). Atkins, inspired by * Autobahn* and Man-Machine, coined the term “techno” after hearing Kraftwerk’s blend of mechanical rhythms and futuristic themes, which mirrored Detroit’s auto industry and post-industrial decay.
