- https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211023

**Summary:**

Microdosing psychedelics has ancient roots in indigenous cultures across Mesoamerica and

South America, where low doses of psychedelic plants (such as: psilocybin mushrooms, peyote,

morning glory seeds, etc) were used daily or ritually for therapeutic benefits like pain relief,

courage, aphrodisiac effects, or treating ailments, alongside higher-dose ceremonies.

The contemporary culture exploded around 2015 in Silicon Valley as a "productivity hack"

among tech workers, influenced by 1960s counterculture (Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

experimented with LSD) and high-pressure optimization trends (nootropics, biohacking, etc).

Media coverage in Rolling Stone and Forbes framed it as enhancing creativity and performance,

spreading globally via online communities (Reddit's r/microdosing).

**Summary:**

RAF's violent legacy (assassinations, kidnappings) symbolized anti-capitalist resistance. Berlin's

techno scene emerged from abandoned spaces (e.g., bunkers, factories) tied to Cold War scars

and RAF-era radicalism. Clubs like Tresor (opened 1991) embodied a "no future" ethos echoing

RAF's nihilism, fostering a DIY, anti-authoritarian vibe. Techno raves were seen as modern

"urban guerrilla" acts against conformity.

- https://americanfootballdatabase.fandom.com/wiki/Bear_Down,_Chicago_Bears

**Summary:**

"Bear Down" is the iconic rallying cry and slogan of the Chicago Bears NFL team, originating

from their official fight song "Bear Down, Chicago Bears", written in 1941. The song was

composed by Al Hoffman under the pseudonym Jerry Downs. Hoffman had no personal ties to

Chicago or the Bears. It was inspired by the Bears' dominant 1940 NFL Championship win (73-0

over the Washington Redskins, still the largest margin in NFL history) during their "Monsters of

the Midway" era, referencing their innovative T-formation offense. The phrase "bear down" is an

old English idiom meaning to exert full effort or pressure (as in childbirth or intense focus),

predating both the song and the team—it's a pun on the Bears' name.

**Summary:**

imgnai, or ImgnAI, is a provocative AI initiative that fuses cryptocurrency, generative art, and

accelerationist philosophy to "accelerate catgirl research," pushing for rapid AGI development

through catgirl-themed imagery and uncensored tools like the Naifu chatbot for taboo roleplay

and conspiracies. Backed by $1.6 million in seed funding led by HackVC, it includes a crypto

token at imgnai.com/token and staged protests at Nvidia's GTC conference with signs and

T-shirts decrying AI regulations. Drawing from Nick Land's accelerationism, CCRU influences,

Milady Maker NFTs, Thelema-inspired manifestos, and a "cute/acc" aesthetic, co-founders

advocate an ironic "speedrun" to techno-singularity, blending artistic emotional boosts with

LLM-driven intelligence surges toward potential human "enslavement" by AI.

ancient Greece, serving from the 8th century BCE until 393 CE. Chosen from local women

(often of humble origin), she entered a trance- possibly induced by ethylene vapors from a

geological chasm to deliver cryptic prophecies interpreted by priests. Known as the most

powerful oracle in the ancient world, she influenced kings, wars, and colonization.

Meanwhile, Skirt of the Pythia refers to the distinctive long, flowing white or purple robe worn by

the Pythia during rituals, symbolizing purity and divine inspiration. She sat upon a sacred tripod

over the chasm, with her skirt draping dramatically, as depicted in ancient art and described in

texts like Plutarch’s writings.
