sucrose’s fermentation by oral bacteria.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** Sugarcane stalks contain 12-20% sucrose

by weight, making it a primary commercial source. The plant, native to Southeast Asia, is

cultivated to tropical regions like Brazil, India, and the Caribbean. In sugarcane, sucrose is

stored in the stalks, then refined to isolate it as white or brown sugar.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): Juicy, fibrous stalks, which are

green to brownish and segmented. Sugarcane juice is a cloudy, sweet liquid (10-15% sucrose)

that turns brownish when processed into molasses or raw sugar.

### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** Kykeon may produce mild psychoactive effects at high doses, and

could theoretically induce visionary experiences. Common side effects include nausea,

vomiting, dizziness, and muscle cramps due to vasoconstriction. High doses can cause

ergotism, a serious condition with symptoms like severe vasoconstriction, convulsions,

hallucinations, or psychosis.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** Found in ergot sclerotia on grasses like rye,

wheat, and barley, with concentrations varying. The fungus thrives in damp conditions,

historically contaminating grain supplies in Europe.

Kykeon contained ergot alkaloids stems from the use of barley in its recipe.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): In nature, it exists in

ergot-infected grains, showing as a dark purple to black sclerotia which replace healthy grain

kernels. These sclerotia are hard and irregular, contrasting with the lighter grain.

Kykeon itself is a liquid beverage, likely cloudy or brownish due to barley and mint, and would

resemble a grain-based porridge or drink, not a pure chemical.

### Effects & Properties

**General Effects:** In the brain, dopamine mediates reward, pleasure, and

motivation, contributing to feelings of satisfaction. It enhances focus, attention, and

goal-directed behavior, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. Physically, dopamine regulates

blood pressure, heart rate, and kidney function by acting as a vasodilator or vasoconstrictor.

Excessive dopamine can cause agitation, paranoia, or psychosis.

**How the Molecule Appears in Nature (Existence):** In animals, dopamine regulates

neurological and physiological processes, In plants, its role is less clear but may involve

defense or signaling. It is an endogenous compound, not requiring external administration for

natural effects.

**- Animal:** Synthesized in the brain, adrenal glands, and peripheral tissues from the amino

acid L-tyrosine via tyrosine hydroxlase. It is found in high concentration in the substantia

nigra, ventral tegmental area, and basal ganglia, playing a role in movement, reward,

and cognition. It is also present in blood and kidneys.

**- Plants:** Found in certain plants, notably bananas (Musa species) and Mucuna pruriens

(velvet beans), where it may function in stress responses or as a precursor to other

compounds. Concentrations in plants are low and not psychoactive when consumed due

to metabolism and blood-brain barrier.

How the molecule appears in nature (physical appearances): In nature, dopamine is not

visible as it exists in trace amounts within tissues or fluids. In its pure form, dopamine is a white

to off-white crystalline powder.
